# Carlos

Sometime in the 1990s, the name "Carlos" got attached to a programming language developed during a Compiler Construction class. The language evolved a little over the years, but was always an imperative and garbage collected scripting language that looked a little like Java would look without all those silly classes.

Time to get the thing on GitHub and build it with Node and Ohm and all the fun stuff in the JavaScript ecosystem.

This project is just getting started. Not much to see at the moment.
